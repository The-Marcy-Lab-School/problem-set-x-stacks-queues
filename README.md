### Short Response Questions
1. What is a stack? (_Be sure to use the term **LIFO** in your response._)

2. What is a queue? (_Be sure to use the term **FIFO** in your response._)

### Coding Exercises

1. Implement a Stack.

2. Implement a Queue.

**Use a Stack to solve the following three problems in linear runtime.**

3. Write a function, `is_balanced_parentheses`, that returns a boolean value based on whether a string has balanced parentheses. Parentheses are balanced if: **(1)** Every open parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis and **(2)** every pair of parentheses begins with an opening parenthesis.

4. Write a function, `is_palindrome`, that takes a string input and determines if the input is a palindrome.

5. Write a function, `decimal_to_binary`, that takes an integer input and returns its binary representation as a string of digits.
